## 🛠 Project Components

### 1. Crankset Design & Topology Optimization
* **Design:** Developed high-performance crank arms designed for maximum power transfer.
* **Analysis:** Static structural simulations conducted under peak pedaling loads (1500N).
* **Optimization:** Leveraged **Ansys Topology Optimization** to identify and remove non-load-bearing material.
* **Reconstruction:** Executed a manual CAD reconstruction from the optimized density mesh to create a smooth, manufacturable parametric model.

### 2. Pedal Assembly
* **Design:** Engineered a lightweight, high-strength pedal geometry with a focus on durability.
* **Validation:** Performed Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to ensure structural integrity against impact forces and fatigue stress.

### 3. Custom "Organic" Frame Design
* **Aesthetic:** A departure from traditional triangular/diamond frame geometry, utilizing a **curved, organic body design**.
* **Geometry:** Focused on custom-swept profiles to explore unique aesthetics while maintaining rigid structural paths.
* **Analysis:** Conducted structural validation to ensure the non-traditional curved members effectively distribute rider and road loads.
