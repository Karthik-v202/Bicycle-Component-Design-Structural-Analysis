# Bicycle Component Design & Optimization

A mechanical engineering project focused on the design, structural validation, and mass optimization of critical bicycle components using CAD and FEA.

## 🛠 Project Components

### 1. Crankset Design & Topology Optimization
* **Design:** Modeled high-performance crank arms optimized for power transfer.
* **Analysis:** Static structural simulations under peak pedaling loads (1500N).
* **Optimization:** Used **Ansys Topology Optimization** to minimize mass, followed by manual CAD reconstruction from the optimized mesh to ensure manufacturing feasibility.

### 2. Pedal Assembly
* **Design:** Engineered a lightweight, high-strength pedal geometry.
* **Validation:** Performed Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to verify durability against impact and fatigue stress.

### 3. Custom Frame Design
* **Aesthetic:** Departed from traditional triangular/diamond frame geometry in favor of a **curved, organic body design**.
* **Geometry:** Focused on custom curved lines to explore unique aesthetics while maintaining structural integrity.
* **Analysis:** Structural validation of the non-traditional geometry to ensure load distribution remains efficient despite the curved profile.

## 💻 Tech Stack
* **CAD:** SolidWorks
* **Simulation:** Ansys (Static Structural, Topology Optimization)

## 🚀 Key Learning Outcomes
* **Mesh-to-CAD Workflow:** Transforming topology-optimized density maps into parametric CAD models.
* **Non-Traditional Design:** Analyzing and validating curved structural members that deviate from standard triangular frames.
* **Structural Analysis:** Understanding load paths and stress concentrations in custom mechanical assemblies.
